<p>There is no question that hardware has been white-hot these past few years. Exits such as Nest and Oculus Rift are just some of the more recent data points in why hardware is hot.</p>
<p>There is plenty that we know about hardware. We know for instance that hardware is hard. We know that mass manufacturing is fraught with difficulty. We know that the proliferation of Adruinos and Raspberry Pis have lowered the barrier to hardware entry.</p>
<p>We also know that not all hardware is the same. Certainly something like the Nest Thermostat is intrinsically different from something like the hoverboard, even though both are fundamentally made up of the same components, such as a processing unit, PCB board &amp; assembly, sensors, casing, etc.</p>
<p>What is it about the Nest Thermostat, or even the Autonomous Car that sets it apart from the ""onesy"" pieces of hardware such as the hoverboards or ""dumb"" cars?</p>
<p>The answer, IMHO, is the Connectivity and Intelligence that is built into one set of devices versus the other. A Connected and Intelligent device is more than just a piece of hardware -- it has the capacity to learn from its peer-device, change its behavior over time, and become integrated into- rather than just be added onto- a consumer's life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Connected &amp; Intelligent devices have requirements that extend those which we traditionally think of as being ""merely"" hardware. On top of everything from the traditional component selection, prototyping, manufacturing, etc., each of these devices now also has to contend with issues such as privacy, security, networking, authentication, etc.</p>
<p>This difference, again IMHO, is what sets apart the Hardware 2.0 era of Smart Home, Smart City, and Smart AllSortsOfThings from their predecessors. The Boston Connected &amp; Intelligent Device Meetup is intended to be a platform for discussion, design, growth, and promotion of such devices.</p>","Babak Kia",64960062

<p>Apache CloudStack is open source software designed to deploy and manage large networks of virtual machines, as a highly available, highly scalable Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) cloud computing platform. CloudStack is used by a number of service providers to offer public cloud services, and by many companies to provide an on-premises (private) cloud offering, or as part of a hybrid cloud solution.</p>
<p>CloudStack is a turnkey solution that includes the entire ""stack"" of features most organizations want with an IaaS cloud: compute orchestration, Network-as-a-Service, user and account management, a full and open native API, resource accounting, and a first-class User Interface (UI).</p>
<p>CloudStack currently supports the most popular hypervisors: VMware, KVM, XenServer and Xen Cloud Platform (XCP).<br>

 Users can manage their cloud with an easy to use Web interface, command line tools, and/or a full-featured RESTful API. In addition, CloudStack provides an API that's compatible with AWS EC2 and S3 for organizations that wish to deploy hybrid clouds.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time, I did Architecture Katas was with &nbsp; 
<a href=""http://twitter.com/tedneward"" target=""_blank"">Ted Neward</a>&nbsp;at a workshop he hosted at &nbsp; 
<a href=""http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/conference/boston/2011/03/home"">NFJS 2011 in Boston</a>.&nbsp;I quite liked the experience. It was fun and very educational.</p>
<p>Three things I liked the most about the&nbsp;workshop&nbsp;was</p>
<p>A) I exercised my brain in way that I normally&nbsp;don't&nbsp;get a chance to do (I know!! I know !!)</p>
<p>B) I heard some excellent ideas from others - who obviously had worked on very&nbsp;different&nbsp;products and had different experiences than mine</p>
<p>C) It was very&nbsp;interesting&nbsp;experience forming a group with a bunch of people I had just met and start to build something together.</p>
<p>When I talked to others who had attended the same workshop, I realized that there are others as well, who are&nbsp;interested&nbsp;as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
  <strong>What to expect ?</strong>
</p>
<p>Its not your&nbsp;usual&nbsp;user group where you come to hear someone's opinion. People will be&nbsp;coming&nbsp;to hear you opinion and you will observe how others approach problem solving.</p>
<p>All attendees will be&nbsp;separated&nbsp;into groups- of three or more. Each group is then given an&nbsp;architectural&nbsp;problem.</p>
<p>The problem statement has requirements and is in some sense vague. You can make reasonable assumption and can approach the ""game-master"" for clarification.</p>
<p>You then have about 45 minutes to discuss the problem and brainstorm within your group. At the end- you give a&nbsp;presentation&nbsp;and others ask questions and critique your proposal (No flashy&nbsp;presentation&nbsp;slides !)</p>

<p>Does GE Predix have the potential to become the engine behind most successful industrial products of the next 10-20 years?&nbsp;Absolutely!&nbsp;</p>
<p>A much better question is how, and in what new ways, can we:&nbsp;</p>
<p>a) do better things with the massive amounts of data coming out of all sorts of machines&nbsp;</p>
<p>b) build industrial IoT applications and predictive APIs at 10x the speed at 1/10 the cost&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Why?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Because with Predix we can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Founders of this group believe that Predix will help conceive, deliver and scale some of the most important industrial advances of the next 10-20 years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So.... why don't we standardize and democratize the field with and around Predix, and help change the world!?&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>What.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>We are a local micro community of those interested in advancing their knowledge of Predix, its use cases and applications.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>How.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Join our group for a regular dose of human interaction, conversations, smiles, food and drinks on all things Predix:&nbsp;</p>
<p>∙&nbsp;How-To’s&nbsp;</p>
<p>∙&nbsp;Review of Predix Services&nbsp;</p>

We want to build a community of Forthers in the New England area that can share knowledge, projects, nifty ideas and experience, and to generally foster and encourage the practice of fine-grained, interactive, minimalist, low-fat computing. These are to be not unlike the SV-FIG, Forth-Gesellschaft groups -- presentations, demos, tutorials and discussions about your projects or things you've seen and heard about! If you have a topic (big or small) send me an email ( andreas.wagner@lowfatcomputing.org ) and I'll add it to the agenda -- DON'T hesitate. <br></p>
<p><b>Why Forth?</b></p>
<p>•&nbsp;Forth is one of the few environments that is totally comprehensible by one person.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Forth has no inherent fixed syntax -- programming is done by extending the language to your application. Thus, it can become what ever you need it to be.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Forth has a ""low floor; high ceiling"" approach to abstraction -- that is, it can be both low level, high level and anywhere in-between.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;You can get an application to run in a minuscule amount of flash or RAM.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;Forth is likely the most compact way to represent software.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;You can try things out interactively in real time as you build your system.</p>
<p>•&nbsp;The compiling functionality is an exposed part of the language like everything else.</p>","Andreas Wagner",183012070

Gather to discuss Development, Standards, Networks, Marketing, Promotion and Business opportunities using AWS. Our group is more technical, so we look for relevant topic matter, and stay away from sales presentations. This Meetup is open to anyone interested in learning more about Amazon Web Services! <br><span> <br><strong>And now for some details...</strong></span></p>
<p><strong>Upcoming Scheduled Meetups:</strong><span> In general, we meet once a month, from 6:30-9pm, with 6:30-7pm for networking and food, and 7-9pm for presentations. Presentations are usually 40min each. And a meetup with this group does Not have to fall on our regular schedule, we are more than happy to schedule additional meetups in a month. <br></span></p>
<p><strong>Attendance:</strong><span> We usually have an attendance of approx. 30-60+ depending on location and topic - and we normally hold these Meetups in the Boston area - however, we are branching out to other areas/facilities. Our attendees are generally in the middle ground between novice and expert, with many in the dev/ops space. If an RSVP list is desired, this can be provided to the host sponsor, however, it ONLY includes the member's Meetup profile name (may not be their real name) and profile link - it does Not contain direct email contact info. <br></span></p>
<p><strong>Presentations:</strong><span> If you wish to present, contact the moderator at awsmeetup@extremereach.com. Suggest a topic and an upcoming meeting(s) that you would be available to present. Then we will need an abstract of the presentation (title and descriptive info) and a bit about the presenter (brief bio, just a few words). We generally have 2-3 presentations/presenters per Meetup without repetition from recent past meetups. If 2 presentations, then these are usually 40min with Q&amp;A. Usually the main sponsor is provided the choice of topic and presentation slot. <br>Our attendees are looking for technical depth and NOT a sales pitch - so please keep this in mind when proposing and creating your presentation. Sometimes it is what you don't say that is important - for example, if you wanted to expose the need for your solution, you can point out all the Amazon-native methods of solving a problem, and in the presentation it becomes clear that an additional solution is needed. Again, we stay away from sales presentations. <br>It’s important that speakers speak loud and clear, in the event a PA system is not available. Also, when questions are asked, the presenter should repeat the question so that all can hear and understand the context of the answer. </span></p>
<p><strong>Presentation - Slides: </strong><span>Usually there are requests for slides after a presentation. We request that presenters post a link to the slides used, as a comment in the applicable Meetup event page. Any comments go to the entire group of subscribers (who have notifications enabled). </span></p>
<p><strong>Sponsorship: </strong><span>A sponsor (location/food) has their logo posted on our Meetup site with link to their site, and is provided time during the Meetup to address attendees. Please see <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Amazon-Web-Services-Meetup-Group/sponsors/"">this link</a> for examples.<br>For help with identifying WHEN would be a good meetup to sponsor, review our upcoming meetups, looking for events not yet sponsored. And, you can always suggest an additional meetup, supplementing our regular monthly meetup. Special events are welcome. <br>Review the <a href=""http://www.meetup.com/The-Boston-Amazon-Web-Services-Meetup-Group/"">upcoming meetups first</a>, then reach out to the moderator at awsmeetup@extremereach.com <br></span></p>
<p><strong>Sponsorship - Food/Drink: </strong><span>We really appreciate our food sponsors and provide them extra time in self-promotion. Food and drink selection is up to the sponsor. Usually a mixed assortment of pizza and salad works well - but this is up to the sponsor. Pretty simple fare for this crowd - and usually no alcohol (but optional if the venue allows). The food sponsor makes all the arrangements - including flatware, napkins, cups, plates, etc. Food is consumed as people arrive and mingle around 6:30pm, and we usually get started with the presentations by 7pm. To help with arranging food, here is a <a href=""https://www.ezcater.com/raf/9190f46efd"">link to ezCater</a>, which makes it easy to select a restaurant close to the venue, estimate the food required to support the 50-60 people, place the order online, and make the delivery arrangements. Expect to pay approx. $450 for food/drink. <br></span></p>
<p><strong>Sponsorship - Location:</strong><span> We are open to a variety of locations. Minimum requirements include a facility that can host approx. 60 attendees, with projector and screen available. The only time we have needed amplification is when the meeting area has significant background noise (like certain climate control systems, or open environments where sound does not carry well). The facility should support groups who allow food and drink on premise. Please specify if alcohol is Not permitted, and/or if there are drinks/snacks or benefits that the facility supplies beyond the space hosting. Usually, attendance requires RSVP for security check-in (if required). Be aware that Meetup members do Not necessarily use their legal name in their profile. Any prerequisites need to be spelled out (like requiring attendees to sign an NDA, or updating their profile with their legal name). The host location sponsor is responsible for posting signage to make it very clear where attendees need to go for the meetup. Please supply any special instructions with regard to directions, parking, security check-in, etc. - these will be posted on the Meetup site. <br> <br>Note: We have arranged with Amazon to use their Boston office several times a year. In general, these Meetups are reserved for sponsors who do Not have a facility to offer. If you require a facility, there are many locations throughout the Boston area, including places like <a href=""http://wework.com"">WeWork</a>, that can be contacted to help facilitate a meeting space. <br></span></p>
<p><strong>Sponsorship - Other Items: </strong><span>There are other forms of sponsorship available, including supplying swag, offering door prizes for info cards being filled out, and covering the Meetup site hosting fees. Please reach out to the moderator for further details and arrangements. awsmeetup@extremereach.com <br></span></p>
<p><strong>Promotion of Other Events: </strong><span>We receive many requests to post outside events, functions, positions, and other items to the Meetup group. Members have provided direct feedback that they do Not want any sales presentations or unrelated solicitations. So, we keep it simple, stay focused on the purpose of this Meetup, and provide opportunities for companies to sponsor or present, and make announcements during the Meetup. In addition, comments can be posted to any of the scheduled Meetup pages on the Meetup site. These comments go out to the entire membership (who have notifications enabled). </span></p>
<p><strong>Attendee List: </strong><span>We are often asked about providing presenters and sponsors the attendee list. Unfortunately, many Meetup registrants use nicknames, and emails are not available. If an RSVP list is desired, this can be provided to the host sponsor, however, it ONLY includes the member's Meetup profile name (may not be their real name) and profile link - it does Not contain direct email contact info. <br>However, presenters/sponsors can post to the Meetup site, commenting on the particular meeting page, which goes out to the entire group (who have notifications enabled). In the comments you can indicate follow-up contact info, offer slides, and drive response to another web link where more info can be gathered from attendees. <br></span></p>
<p><b>What Next?&nbsp;</b> <br><i>Sponsors:</i> Identify a meetup date and reach out to the moderator with a description of your desired involvement, and any additional questions not answered above. <br><i>Presenters:</i> Provide topic/abstract and indicate when you could be available to provide the presentation. <br></p>

<p><span>Test faster. &nbsp;Release Sooner.</span></p>
<p><span>Everyone wants to release the next hot app or bulletproof their website. But until now, it took a unique breed to thoroughly test them and to ensure they’ll perform at scale. That’s because functional and performance testing have traditionally been challenging, complex, costly and time-consuming. But not anymore. SOASTA is driven by a radical idea: Make powerful testing accessible to anyone. Do it in the cloud. Make it visual and far less complex. Deliver immediate actionable intelligence in real time. And incorporate testing for gesture and touch interfaces. Our SOASTA Platform, products and services are like no one else’s—uniquely innovative, flexible, fast, affordable and exceptionally effective. And we think that’s cool.</span></p>

<p>What becomes possible tomorrow is super exciting and scary at the same time.

Specifically, I will be finding and securing physical locations where members of this group could meet in person, share and discuss ideas.</p>

 <p>The argument for open source (""free"" as in speech) software is stronger than ever.</p>

<p>1. Creating a community of GNU/Linux on the desktop enthusiasts.</p>
<p>2. Providing a venue where GNU/Linux questions can get asked by users of all levels.</p>
<p>3. Fostering GNU/Linux on the desktop evangelism. Let's spread the word!</p>

<p><b>Does The Hyperledger Project have the potential to become the engine behind most successful decentralized applications and organizations created in the next 25-50 years? Absolutely! </b></p>
<p>A much better question is how, and in what new ways, can we: </p>
<p>a) Build decentralized applications, organizations and APIs at 10x the speed at 1/10 the cost.</p>
<p>b) Build situational awareness in the local community.</p>
<p>I believe that the convergence of decentralized applications, decentralized organizations, artificial intelligence and IoT brings upon us the Great Displacement of the 21st century, where the majority of workforce will be left without “conventional” jobs, forced to learn new skills and professions. </p>
<p><b>Why? </b></p>
<p>Founders of this group believe that the Hyperledger Foundation will be the engine behind decentralization of the world, a massive economic change of the next 25-50 years. </p>
<p>So.... why don't we standardize and democratize the field with and around Hyperledger? </p>
<p><b>What? </b></p>
<p>We are a local micro community of those interested in advancing their knowledge of Hyperledger, its use cases and applications. </p>
<p><b>How? </b></p>
<p>Join our group for a regular dose of human interaction, conversations, smiles, food and drinks on all things Hyperledger: </p>
<p>• Use Cases</p>
<p>• Competitive analysis of Hyperledger startups (Distributed Apps from disruptive companies in specific vertical markets)</p>
<p>• How-To’s </p>
<p>• Interviews with individuals working at the edge of the Hyperledger project</p>
<p>• Reviews of tools, services and APIs offered by the Hyperledger ecosystem</p>
<p>• Best Practices in Application Architecture</p>
<p>• Do’s and Don’ts </p>
<p>• Application Templates</p>
<p>• Hackathons</p>
<p>• Security in the decentralized world - on the edge, on the node, in the cloud and in transit</p>
<p>• How others solve some of the hard problems that exist in the world using Hyperledger.</p>
